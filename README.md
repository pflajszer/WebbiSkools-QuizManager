# Database connection

If you'd like to run the application locally against the local database, you have create that LocalDB and replace the connection string in appsettings.json. Alternatively, you can use the test database Connection String (can be found in Project Outputs and Deliverables.docx), in which case please reach out to me directly with your IP address, as I may have to add your IP to the whitelist. the online version of the application can be used without any of the above and can be found here: http://webbiskools-quizmanager.azurewebsites.net/
